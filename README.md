# GirlNinjaClass

A small project designed to give young children (7+) a small introduction to program construction by providing a pretty much blank template for a side scroller game that can be built up into a mostly functional game.

Some of the ideas that can be conveyed using this as a hands on demo / interactive tutorial:

1. Coding can often be broken down into smaller, simpler, problems that when combined create something cool
2. Everyone has their own style, and everyone should be able to express that in their code and final product
3. Programs have bugs (especially when you forget a critical rule). We find them, fix them, and then find more!
4. *(slightly more advanced)* We often have constraints within our programs that we need to work within

## Usage

Sorry, no fancy node etc (future? :) ). For now all you need is to grab the sources and stick everything under `src/` onto a webserver somewhere (`localhost` works fine).

I generally maintain a working version at https://www.nachmore.com/gwc
